# Calculate_Moire_Vectors
A GUI for determing the moire vectors produced between two sets of real-space lattice vectors.
There are two files containing in this repository that perform the same function. "Calculate_moire_GUI_rt_vectors.py" accepts vector inputs in the form of vector length 1, vector length 2, and angle between the vectors. For example, a square unit cell input would be something like "1","1","90". "Calculate_moire_GUI_xy_vectors.py" accepts vector inputs in the form of vector 1 x component, vector 1 y component, vector 2 x component, vector 2 y component. For example, a square unit cell input would be something like "1","0","0","1".
